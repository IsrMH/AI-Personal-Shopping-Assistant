Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project aims to develop an AI-driven personal shopping assistant that provides personalized shopping recommendations based on user preferences and shopping history.

Building AI course project

## Background

The problem addressed by this project is the overwhelming choice in online shopping, which can lead to decision fatigue. Consumers often spend a significant amount of time searching for the right products. My personal motivation stems from my own experiences of feeling overwhelmed while shopping online. This project is important because it can save time, reduce stress, and enhance the shopping experience by offering personalized recommendations.

* Decision fatigue due to overwhelming product choices.
* Time-consuming process of finding suitable products.

## How is it used?

The AI-driven personal shopping assistant is used in online shopping environments. Users interact with the assistant via a web or mobile app. The assistant analyzes user preferences and shopping history to provide tailored product recommendations.

1. **User signs up and provides initial preferences**: Users input their preferences and interests during sign-up.
2. **AI analyzes data**: The AI processes user preferences, shopping history, and available product data.
3. **Personalized recommendations**: The assistant offers product recommendations based on the analysis.
4. **Feedback loop**: Users provide feedback on recommendations, which the AI uses to improve future suggestions.

## Data sources and AI methods

Data sources for this project include:
* User preference data: Collected during user sign-up and via ongoing interactions.
* Shopping history: Past purchases and browsing history.
* Product data: Information about products from various online retailers.

AI techniques:
* **Collaborative filtering**: To recommend products based on user similarity.
* **Content-based filtering**: To recommend products based on item similarity.
* **Natural language processing (NLP)**: To analyze user reviews and feedback.

| Data Source    | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| User Preferences | Initial user input on preferences and interests |
| Shopping History | Data on past purchases and browsing behavior |
| Product Data     | Details of products from various online sources |

## Challenges

What this project does not solve:
* It does not handle products that are out of stock or discontinued.
* It might face challenges in understanding nuanced user preferences without enough data.
* Ethical considerations include data privacy and ensuring that recommendations are not biased or discriminatory.

## What next?

To grow this project, the next steps could include:
* Integrating with more online retailers to provide a wider range of products.
* Enhancing the AI model with more sophisticated algorithms for better recommendations.
* Collaborating with UX designers to improve user interaction and experience.
* Gathering more user feedback to continuously improve the recommendation system.

Skills and assistance needed:
* Data scientists for improving AI algorithms.
* Software developers for building and maintaining the app.
* UX/UI designers for enhancing user experience.
